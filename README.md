A busy perrson, often struggles with deciding what to eat. To address this problem, I developed a Meal Suggestion App using Kotlin in Android Studio. This app simplifies meal choices based on the time of the day, making meal selection more convenient and enjoyable. The user inputs a time of day, and the app suggests an appropriate meal while displaying an image.

Purpose of the App
The Meal Suggestion App aims to:
•	Provide quick meal recommendations based on different times of the day.
•	Offer a user-friendly interface for effortless interaction.
•	Display visual meal representations for better decision-making.
•	Implement error handling for incorrect user input.
•	Maintain code efficiency and version control using GitHub and GitHub Actions.
This app is particularly useful for individuals with busy schedules who want a fast and effective way to plan meals without thinking too much about it.

Design Considerations
The development of the Meal Suggestion App involved several key design considerations to ensure usability, efficiency, and maintainability.
User Interface Design
The app follows a simple and clean UI design with the following components:
•	Text Input Field: Allows users to enter a time of day (e.g., “Morning,” “Afternoon,” “Dinner”).
•	Buttons:
o	“Suggest Meal” button to generate a meal recommendation.
o	“Reset” button to clear the input and reset the interface.
•	TextView: Displays the suggested meal.
•	ImageView: Shows an image of the recommended meal.
Meal Suggestion Logic
The meal recommendations are structured based on if-else conditions:
Time of Day	Suggested Meal
Morning	Breakfast (Eggs)
Mid-Morning	Light Snack (Fruit)	
Afternoon	Lunch (Sandwich)	
Mid-Afternoon	Quick Bite (Cake)	
Dinner	Main Course (Pasta)	
After Dinner	Dessert (Ice Cream)
If a user enters an invalid time, an error message prompts them to enter a correct value.
Error Handling
To prevent incorrect inputs, the app:
•	Validates user input using string matching.
•	Displays clear error messages for invalid entries.
•	Ensures a smooth user experience by guiding users toward correct input.

Utilization of GitHub and GitHub Actions
To ensure efficient collaboration, GitHub and GitHub Actions were used for version control and automated testing.
GitHub for Version Control
•	A GitHub repository was created to manage the app’s source code.
•	Regular commits and pushes were made to track progress.
•	Branching was utilized for feature development and bug fixes.
GitHub Actions for Automation
To maintain code quality and reliability, GitHub Actions was implemented. It automates:
1.	Continuous Integration – Ensures the app builds successfully.
2.	Automated Testing – Verifies the correctness of implemented features.

The Meal Suggestion App was successfully designed and developed to help users quickly decide on meals based on the time of day. With a user-friendly UI, effective meal logic, and GitHub integration, this app ensures a smooth and maintainable experience. The use of GitHub Actions further enhances code reliability through automated testing and continuous integration. Future improvements could include a database for dynamic meal options and voice input functionality for an even better user experience.
